# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction – End-to-End Data Science Project

This notebook presents a complete machine learning pipeline on the classic Titanic dataset. It walks through **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **feature engineering**, and **model training** to predict passenger survival.

---

## 📌 Project Goals

- Understand the structure and trends in Titanic data  
- Engineer meaningful features from raw data  
- Compare machine learning models (Logistic Regression vs Random Forest)  
- Generate accurate predictions for Kaggle submission  

---

## 🔍 Key Highlights

✅ Cleaned missing values (`Age`, `Fare`, `Embarked`)  
✅ Engineered new features like `FamilySize`  
✅ Visualized survival trends by gender, class, age group, etc.  
✅ Trained & compared models:
- Logistic Regression (Accuracy: 81%)
- Random Forest Classifier (Accuracy: 82.6%)

✅ Created `submission.csv` for Kaggle competition  
✅ Explained insights and model decisions throughout
